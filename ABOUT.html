Okay so we are making a whole website that has all of my interests in it.
Header.html - gonna have a unique header that will be applied to all further pages. I realized this is going to help for complexity later on and should be consistent throughout.
Global-header.js - this is going to call the header, so we can just mess with header.html as we go and not worry about it affecting other parts as it was before.
index.html - this is our homepage, going to make it a little more interactive and not just be a regular landing page. This will hopefully entice others to click through.
food.html - going to be everything about food and when I feel like talking about it, it's there
travel.html - blog style page that'll have our trips along with the recommendations and possibly a hard itinerary for others to follow
mentoring.html - I enjoy helping others, maybe this will help me categorize my help and allow me to target specific people

Goal overall is to learn to build a website using my previous knowledge and a whole lotta chat gpt. Using chatgpt to also help me create something of my imagination.
